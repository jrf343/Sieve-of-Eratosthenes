# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes

This small file contains an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a classic algorithm used to identify smaller primes within some range. The 
implementation is meant to accompany my research and analysis of the algorithm, included as a pdf here. 

For our purposes today, the sieve is incredibly inefficient at determining prime numbers. However, any fan of history and beauty can appreciate its
simplicity and effectiveness.
